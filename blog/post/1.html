                <h1>Personal SWOT analysis</h1>
                    <p>What are your strengths?</p>
                    <p>1. My honesty. I will always offer honest and constructive feedback.
                        2. Work ethic. Whenever possible, I will stay at school until I have finished my assignment, unable to get the help needed to progress, or I have exhausted all energy.
                        3. I enjoy figuring out new things whenever I am not under (too much) pressure.
                        4. It brings me joy to see my creations come closer and closer to completion.
                        5. I am very sensitive to details and good coding practices. I like making everything look organised and nice.
                        6. I take joy and pride in achieving high marks.
                        7. I no longer seek social approval to do what I need or want to do. Nor do I crave validation anymore.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>What are your weaknesses?</p>
                    <p>1. I am easily distracted, but I am taking medication to help with my ADD.
                        2. My self-esteem is tied to my performance.
                        3. I heavily rely on body language to interpret intention.
                        4. My honesty can cause issues working with a shy or prideful team. I can often recognise social issues, but I lack the intuition natural to neurotypical people to understand why they feel the way they do. To avoid conflicts I take on an apologetic tone before or right after engagement.
                        5. I cannot keep up physically with other students on fun trips.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Which opportunities do you see?</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Which threats do you see?</p>
                    <p>1. As the studies advance I will have less and less direct access to teachers. I see myself asking a lot of questions and getting stuck often with new languages.
                        2. I have been rated by the UWV (government organisation that manages welfare and unemployment benefits) to be fit for 34 hours of work a week. The study is rated at 40 hours.
                        Through sheer stubbornness and will shall I force myself to overextend, but I would not be surprised if I would need to redo a year.
                        3. I have dyscalculia, which means I have difficulties recognising and applying numbers in the right context, as well as having a distorted sense of time.</p>
