                <h1>Study choice</h1>
                    <p>As wee little lass, my father would bring discarded electronics from work or the recycling plant for me and my brother to play with.</p>
                    <p>I was always intrigued by the circuitry and loved asking my father what everything was. I liked taking it apart and trying to reassemble it.</p>
                    <p>But I had to hurry; my younger brother would get a hammer to smash the device to pieces for his enjoyment.</p>
                    <p>You can guess who is studying IT and who enlisted into the army.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Before enrolling to HBO-ICT, I graduated from tradeschool (MBO-4 highest tier) as a network engineer and system administrator.</p>
                    <p>Whereas my highschool education was Havo, which is the second highest difficulty.</p>
                    <p>After which I enrolled for to HBO-ICT the first time. I passed my propedeutic phase, but I quit thereafter to work.</p>
                    <p>Six years later, I am back. This time to finish what I started.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After 4 years I hope to be sufficiently skilled to easily master new languages and techniques so I can be adaptable enough to apply for any job.</p>
                    <p>I hope to see myself working in a small and cozy company where my limitations are respected and taken into account.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy knowing many things and using this knowledge to help other people.</p>
                    <p>I fear I do not have the mathematical acumen to properly study the inner workings of LLMs, despite my interest in them.</p>
                    <p>My preferred role would be something that involves either hardware/server management, or to be a team leader of sorts.</p>
                    <p>I am better at talking than coding, despite my interest in the subject.</p>
