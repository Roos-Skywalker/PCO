                <p>Welcome to my page. At the time of pushing this update I am 28 years old and enrolled in the first class of HZ University of Applied Sciences.</p>
                <p>You can find my <a href="https://github.com/Roos-Skywalker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github here (opens in new tab)</a></p>.

            <h1>Okay, but why?</h1>
                <p>Six years ago I enrolled as well. I passed my propaedeutic year, but due to personal circumstances and COVID-19 I was unable to continue.</p>
                <p>Now unfettered by fear of failure and resource restraints, I am able to pursue college once more.</p>
            <h1>Six year gap, what happened?</h1>
                <p>Between those years I have worked various jobs; chiefly at Saman Group (a company that specialises in installing green energy solutions and home heating).</p>
                <p>I served three roles: customer service data processing and automation; financial administration and automation; and finally Service & Maintenance where I created and maintained customer contracts.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, after solar panel market crash there was insufficient work available to me, as well as the IT team working on an AI-based solution to replace me, after which my contract wasn't converted into a permanent one.</p>
                <p>After this encounter I decided I would return to school if I could not secure a permanent contract next job.</p>
            <h1>A loser catching bigger losers</h1>
                <p>That next job was working for the police as an assistant detective. My job was to investigate cybercrime and digital forensics.</p>
                <p>I recognised suspects on camera, and searched seized devices such as phones and laptops for incriminating evidence.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, my mentor was unable to sufficiently assist me due to his cancer treatments. Due to understaffing they could not find a suitable replacement, so I was let go.</p>
                <p>That's when I had enough. It was time to go back to my roots; my passion.</p>
                <p>IT</p>
